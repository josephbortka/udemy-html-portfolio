    <p>Growing up, I had an adventurous childhood. Living across several states, and moving schools many times taught me much.</p>
    <p>I could say much more, and perhaps will in another section. For our purposes here, that is a summary of my philosophy of life, I aspire to use what talents God has given me, in whatever role he bestows, to advance two priorities: <ol>
        <li>The advancement of humanity towards becoming an interstellar species, and</li>
        <li>Lighting Sam Adams' brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p> It seems Elon Musk has the first covered for the forseeable future, and is doing superbly at it. My life has led me down a track better suited to influencing the other. From this it is clear where God is calling me. This freedom is not a heathen freedom of debauchery, rather the Christian moral liberty which this country was built on, which allowed for very little interference from government for many years. Though through the years many have sought to stamp it out, the smouldering embers of this brushfire are being brought back to a blaze. We were put here for such a time as this.
