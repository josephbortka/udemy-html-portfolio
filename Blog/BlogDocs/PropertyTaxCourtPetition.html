    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>December 13, 2024</p>
    <p>Recently a man named Steve Osbourn attempted a feat one might compare to mythical dragon slaying. He challenged the constitutionality of Indiana's property tax system in court, pro se. He is has appealed all the way to the Indiana Supreme Court. For reference, the case number is 22T-TA-00012.</p>
    <p>Being that the courts are notorius for brushing pro se litigants under the rug, and also being that I happen to agree with his argument that property tax liens and sales are a violation of natural rights retained under the 9th amendment of the constitution, I sought to assist him however I could.</p>
    <p>First I attempted to go through the more proper means of filing an amicus brief, which is where a citizen who is not a party to a case asks the court to consider their perspective. I did ask for an extension to file a more thorough brief since I was not informed of Mr. Osbourn's intent to file for Supreme Court review. My petition was denied.</p>
    <p>At this point I was done asking. Amici approach the court as subjects, but as you may recall from civics class, in the United States, government is a subject of the people rather than the other way around. Article 1 §31 of the Indiana Constitution states that no law shall restrain the People from instructing their government. Framed as an instruction by right, rather than a prayer to the court for permission, I quickly formulated an instructive petition based on some similar petitions I have observed from <a href="https://x.com/RealDaveCares4u">David Jose</a> and <a href="https://x.com/JarrinJackson">Jarrin Jackson</a>, but with my own flair. I brought it to a local GOP meeting, where I obtained several signatures. This I took and filed with the court.</p>
    <p>Now I am not certain it will even be read by the judges. I sure hope it will, but it is possible that clerks and attorneys in the office may be so protective of the judges' bandwidth that they won't even be made aware of the filing. This would be unfortunate, but it must be noted that while such petitioning is constitutionally protected, this methodology doesn't mesh with their established systems.
    </p>Activism of any kind which seeks to change an entire society must always start with planting seeds. Some fall on rocky soil, some on weedy soil, and a select few on fertile soil. We ask God for his blessing, plant the seed and the rest is up to Him. Below is what I filed with the court for your perusal.</p>

    <h3>Notice of Instruction on the Taxation of Private Property pursuant to. Ind. Const. Art. 1§31
    </h3>
    <p>I, Joseph Bortka, one of the People pursuant to Article 1 §1 of the Indiana Constitution and the Preamble of the United States Constitution, <i>sui juris</i></i><a href="#li1"><sup>1</sup></a>, hereby remind and instruct all trustees of the People of Indiana (pursuant to Ind. Const. Art. 1§31, 15§4), including and especially the Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court, of the following Law:<a href="#li2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>The private rights of the People derive from God, not the state. The state is delegated its authority in the constitution by the people for the express purpose of protecting those private rights. When the state becomes destructive to those ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish this government.<a href="#li3"><sup>3</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>As evidenced in the 9th amendment, the rights retained by the people are not limited to those particular rights listed in the federal, or any one state constitution. Evidence of those natural rights may be found in all 50 state constitutions, and foundational documents of the Common Law of England, such as the Magna Carta in 1215, the Petition of Right in 1628, the Grand Remonstrance in 1641, the English Bill of Rights in 1689, and others. All in their time were expressions of the people rebuking their Government for its abuses, and reinforcing the government's only chief duty and purpose... protecting the rights of the People.<a href="#li4"><sup>4</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>The private right of natural persons<a href="#li5"><sup>5</sup></a> to own real property is an ancient right, which cannot be abrogated save by due process of law by a trial by a jury of the person's peers.<a href="#li6"><sup>6</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>With the abolition of monarchy, real property ownership in law ceased to derive its authority from the permission of the crown, rather natural persons became the lords of their own lawfully obtained real property in allodium; that is, without debt of tallage, lease, or feudal tenure.<a href="#li7"><sup>7</sup></a> The People became the sovereigns in this country.<a href="#li8"><sup>8</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the imposition of rents by the state on the People's privately held property, which operates only under the color of a lawful tax, serves to invert the relationship between master and servant. The creative renaming of this <i>de facto</i> feudal tenure does not serve to magically transform the rent into a tax and thereby absolve its unlawfulness.    
    </p>
    <p>Trustees are hereby instructed to fulfill their oath-sworn duty to uphold the constitution and the rights protected therein, by declaring it unconscionable, unconstitutional, and unlawful for the state to impose a perpetual duty on the property of natural persons. The use of clever linguistic workarounds relying on inferior rules, statutes, and precedents to avoid addressing the issue before the court, would constitute an abdication of responsibility, and a breach of the fiduciary relationship between the People and their trustees.<a href="#li1"><sup>9</sup></a> Trustees have hereby been informed, and may not plead ignorance of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>Signed, <u>/s/Joseph Bortka</u>
